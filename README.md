# eCom store

![image](/public/ecom-store.png)

This project was designed to simulate the core functionality of a modern online store, allowing users to browse products, view detailed information, manage a shopping cart, and complete a purchase — all within a seamless, single-page application. The purpose was to apply front-end development concepts in a practical, real-world scenario using React.

## Description

For my JavaScript Frameworks project, I built a fully responsive eCommerce web application using React, focusing on core front-end skills like routing, API integration, state management, and form validation. The goal was to deliver a seamless shopping experience with clean, modular code and a strong UI/UX.

- Five Core Pages: Homepage, Product Page, Cart Page, Checkout Success Page, and Contact Page — all dynamically rendered with React Router.
- API Integration: Products are fetched from a public API and displayed using reusable components with real-time search functionality.
- Shopping Cart System: Users can add items to a cart, see totals, and complete purchases. Cart state is managed globally.
- Validated Contact Form: Includes field validation for name, subject, email, and message.
- Responsive Design: Built with styled-components for modular, mobile-friendly styling.
- Deployment: Hosted on Netlify and accessible online.
